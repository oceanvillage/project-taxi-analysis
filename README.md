## Overview<br>
  NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) likes to generate more revenues for taxi drivers utilizing the data provided.<br>
  Try tree-based modeling technique to predict better chipper on a binary target class<br>
<br>

<br>
## Results<br>
![graph 1](/assets/graph_1.png)![graph 2](/assets/graph_2.png)<br>
![table 1](/assets/table_1.png)<br>
<br>
  1) Precision & Accuracy look acceptable<br>
  2) False Positive(FP) is almost 3 times of False Negative(FN).<br>
     i.e. This model will inform the driver of generous tipping expected 3 times more but, at the end, it will not be the case.<br>
